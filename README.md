# Features

Tile Matching: Swap adjacent tiles to form a horizontal or vertical match of at least three identical tiles.

Special Tiles: Unique power-ups appear based on match combinations:

Striped Tile: Clears an entire row or column when activated.

Rainbow Tile: Collects all normal tiles of the same color as the trigger tile (excluding other Rainbow tiles).

Bomb Tile: Clears a 3x3 area around the activated tile.

Scoring System: Gain points for each successful match and aim for the highest score.

Move Limit: Players must achieve the best possible score within a set number of moves.

Deadlock Detection: If no valid moves remain, the board automatically reshuffles to continue gameplay.

# How to Play

Swap two adjacent tiles to create a match of at least three of the same color.

Matching more than three tiles creates special tiles with unique abilities.

Use special tiles strategically to clear large areas and maximize points.

Reach the highest score possible before running out of moves.
